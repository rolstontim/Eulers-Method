Euler.py is a program designed for csc349a assignment 1. To work this
program simply run the file through a terminal and choose which function 
you would like to call. Then enter in the requested values for the inputs to
the function. The output will be a text file that will appear in the same
location as where the .py file was called.

It should be noted that for question 1.b) and 1.c) instead of creating
a new function, I just changed the name of the text file output within the
python file. That is on line 17 I changed "Euler_output_1b)" to 
"Euler_output_1c)" when computing an output for 1.c).
